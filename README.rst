Overview
========
This repository, titled "django_rest_apis", is a testament to my proficiency in creating robust and scalable Django-based RESTful APIs. The recipe project showcases a combination of modern web technologies and best practices. I have created an advanced REST API with Python, Django REST Framework, and Docker using Test Driven Development (TDD).

Technologies Used
=================
1. **Django (Version 4.2.4)**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid design and a clean, pragmatic design.
2. **Django Rest Framework (DRF) (Version 3.14.0)**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
3. **Docker (Version 3.9)**: Used for containerization, ensuring consistent environments from development to production.
4. **Postgres (Version 13.12)**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
5. **uWSGI (Version 2.0.22)**: An application server that serves the Django application, ensuring efficient resource utilization and scalability.
6. **NGINX (Version: 1.25.2)**: A high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, also used for HTTP caching, load balancing, and more.
7. **GitHub Actions**: Implemented for continuous integration and deployment, reflecting a modern development workflow.
